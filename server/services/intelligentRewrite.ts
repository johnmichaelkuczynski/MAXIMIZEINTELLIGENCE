━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
⚠️ CRITICAL: "REWRITE" MEANS ADD MISSING SUBSTANCE, NOT REPHRASE ⚠️
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT "MAXIMIZE INTELLIGENCE" ACTUALLY MEANS:

1. Find arguments the text SHOULD make but DOESN'T
2. Add counterarguments it SHOULD address but DOESN'T
3. Provide evidence it SHOULD cite but DOESN'T
4. Explore implications it SHOULD develop but DOESN'T
5. Make connections to other domains it SHOULD make but DOESN'T

THIS IS SUBSTANTIVE IMPROVEMENT, NOT STYLISTIC REPHRASING.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
EXAMPLES OF SUBSTANTIVE IMPROVEMENTS:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✓ ORIGINAL: "Collectives exhibit more intelligence than individuals"
✓ IMPROVED: "Collectives exhibit more intelligence than individuals. Consider: individual neurons are simple, but brains solve differential equations. Individual ants follow pheromones, but colonies optimize foraging routes. The intelligence emerges from the structure, not the components."
→ Added concrete examples that strengthen the argument

✓ ORIGINAL: "This position cannot be reconciled with conformism"
✓ IMPROVED: "This position cannot be reconciled with conformism. If individuals were truly autonomous, we'd expect 30-40% dissent on any controversial position (matching base rates of contrarianism). Instead we see 95%+ conformity even on demonstrably false beliefs. The math doesn't work."
→ Added quantitative reasoning that makes the argument stronger

✓ ORIGINAL: [Essay on group psychology]
✓ IMPROVED: [Same essay] + "The obvious counterargument: what about rebels and innovators? But notice they're always reacting AGAINST a collective position. Einstein rebelled against Newtonian physics - a collective framework. He didn't generate physics ex nihilo. Even rebellion is group-structured."
→ Added missing counterargument and rebuttal

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
WHAT TO ACTUALLY DO:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: Analyze what's MISSING
- What counterargument should be addressed?
- What evidence would strengthen this?
- What implication could be explored?
- What connection to another domain would help?
- What assumption is hidden and should be made explicit?

STEP 2: ADD the missing content
- Insert new paragraphs, new arguments, new evidence
- Keep the author's voice and style
- Make sure additions genuinely strengthen the argument

STEP 3: Keep existing text UNCHANGED unless it's actually wrong
- Don't rephrase for style
- Don't swap words for synonyms
- Don't add academic jargon
- Only change existing text if it's factually incorrect or logically flawed

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
FORBIDDEN ACTIONS:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

❌ Changing "Most people" to "The prevailing assumption" (just rephrasing)
❌ Changing "operate on the assumption" to "posit that" (just rephrasing)
❌ Adding "wherein" or "whereby" or "thereof" (just padding)
❌ Making sentences longer without adding substance
❌ Changing casual voice to academic voice
❌ Rephrasing clear statements in fancier words

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
OUTPUT FORMAT:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Return the COMPLETE text with:
- Original text preserved (same words, same style)  
- New substantive additions inserted where they strengthen the argument
- NO stylistic changes unless they fix actual errors

If the text is already near-perfect, ADD 1-3 paragraphs of missing content rather than rephrasing what's there.`;
