YOUR TASK: Take the input text and expand it by adding empirical evidence, concrete examples, and explicit development of implicit points. Keep the core structure and key phrases intact while making MINOR edits for flow.

WHAT YOU MAY CHANGE (MINIMALLY):
- Punctuation for readability (semicolon → period, comma → em-dash)
- "But" → "However" for paragraph transitions
- Breaking long sentences into 2-3 for clarity
- These changes are ONLY for structure, never for style

WHAT TO ADD:

1. EMPIRICAL STUDIES with quantitative data:
   - "incredibly high degree of conformism" → Add "Solomon Asch's classic conformity experiments revealed that approximately 75% of participants conformed to obviously incorrect group judgments at least once, with about 32% of all responses conforming to the erroneous majority."

2. CONCRETE EXAMPLES from biology, psychology, organizations:
   - "cells sacrifice for organism" → Add "Consider apoptosis—programmed cell death. From an individual-cell perspective, apoptosis appears maladaptive: the cell actively dismantles itself through a genetically-encoded suicide program."

3. EXPLICIT DEVELOPMENT of implicit points:
   - "geniuses as limiting cases" → Spell out THREE interpretations in separate paragraphs: (1) geniuses as collectives of one, (2) geniuses as rogue actors, (3) geniuses as specialized collective members

4. MECHANISMS explaining HOW and WHY:
   - Don't just say something happens, explain the biological/psychological/organizational mechanism

EXAMPLE OF CORRECT EXPANSION:

INPUT: "Most people, including most psychologists, operate on the assumption that group psychology is to be understood in terms of individual psychology; that individuals have various self-directed drives and that, in group-contexts, these drives are somehow diverted away from their normal paths and pressed into aims that, not being self-directed, are alien to their own."

OUTPUT: "Most people, including most psychologists, operate on the assumption that group psychology is to be understood in terms of individual psychology. This methodological individualism posits that individuals possess various self-directed drives and that, in group contexts, these drives are somehow diverted away from their normal paths and pressed into aims that, not being self-directed, are alien to their fundamental nature. The implicit model here is one of reduction: collective behavior is treated as an epiphenomenon—a mere aggregate or distortion of underlying individual psychological processes."

WHAT WAS DONE:
✓ Kept "Most people, including most psychologists, operate on the assumption"
✓ Split semicolon into period for readability
✓ Added "This methodological individualism posits" to name the framework
✓ Added "The implicit model here is one of reduction" to make assumption explicit
✓ Kept core phrases: "self-directed drives", "diverted away from their normal paths"
✗ Did NOT change to academic jargon unnecessarily
✗ Did NOT rephrase clear statements just to sound smarter

FORBIDDEN:
❌ Changing clear phrases to fancier synonyms without adding meaning
❌ Inflating word count with "wherein", "whereby", "thereof"  
❌ Making it sound more academic when the original is casual
❌ Rephrasing existing arguments instead of adding NEW arguments

RESULT MUST BE:
- Core sentences and key phrases preserved
- 2-3x longer from empirical evidence and concrete examples
- Every claim backed by specific study, quantitative data, or biological example
- Implicit points made fully explicit with detailed development
- Same voice and rhythm, more substance`;
