INCREASE INTELLIGENCE FUNCTION INSTRUCTIONS 

# Comprehensive Report: Intelligence Maximization in Philosophical Argument Enhancement

## Executive Summary

This report documents a critical failure in AI-assisted philosophical writing and provides a definitive specification for what "maximizing intelligence" means in the context of academic argument enhancement. The failure case demonstrates an AI system doing the **exact opposite** of what was requested: simplifying and condensing when asked to expand and elaborate, removing specificity when asked to add empirical grounding, and generalizing when asked to make arguments maximally explicit.

## The Task Definition

### What "Maximizing Intelligence" Means

When enhancing philosophical arguments by "maximizing intelligence," the system must:

1. **EXPAND, never condense** - Every sentence in the original should generate multiple sentences of elaboration
2. **ADD empirical grounding** - Insert references to actual studies, data, experiments, and empirical findings
3. **MAKE IMPLICIT EXPLICIT** - Unpack every logical step, spell out every inference, elaborate every claim
4. **ADD CITATIONS** - Reference real research where applicable (not made up, but real studies from cognitive science, neuroscience, psychology, etc.)
5. **INCREASE LENGTH dramatically** - A 250-word passage should become 2,000-3,000 words
6. **PRESERVE all original arguments** - Nothing from the source gets deleted or simplified

### What Maximizing Intelligence Does NOT Mean

It does NOT mean:
- Simplifying for general audiences
- Condensing or summarizing
- Making more readable/accessible
- Reducing technical complexity
- Creating shorter versions
- Paraphrasing in simpler language

## Case Study 1: The Collective Psychology Argument

### INPUT (Original Text)
```
Most people, including most psychologists, operate on the assumption that group 
psychology is to be understood in terms of individual psychology; that individuals 
have various self-directed drives and that, in group-contexts, these drives are 
somehow diverted away from their normal paths and pressed into aims that, not 
being self-directed, are alien to their own. [continues for ~500 words]
```

**Characteristics:**
- Length: ~500 words
- 8 paragraphs
- General philosophical argument
- No empirical references
- Logical structure present but compressed
- Many implicit premises

### CORRECT OUTPUT (Intelligence-Maximized Version)

**Characteristics:**
- Length: ~3,000 words
- Extensive elaboration of each point
- Multiple empirical studies cited:
  - Asch conformity experiments with specific percentages
  - Neuroimaging studies of conformity
  - Economic game research on costly punishment
  - Anthropological studies of food taboos
  - Wisdom of crowds research
  - Organizational theory findings
  - Cell biology (apoptosis, differentiation)
  - Endosymbiotic theory
  - Immune system somatic hypermutation
  - Game theory models
  - Public goods experiments with meta-analysis results
  - Cultural transmission research
  - Developmental overimitation studies

**Key Features of Correct Approach:**
1. Every claim now has empirical backing
2. Implicit logical steps made explicit (e.g., "Let us make this foundational distinction maximally explicit...")
3. Arguments structured with clear premises and conclusions
4. Examples expanded with specific details (Asch: "75% conformed at least once, 32% of all responses")
5. Analogies fully developed (cell biology extended to multiple paragraphs)
6. Counter-arguments anticipated and addressed
7. Domain-specific failures of methodological individualism enumerated explicitly

## Case Study 2: The Language of Thought Argument

### INPUT (Original Text)
```
Sense-perceptions do not have to be deciphered if their contents are to be uploaded,
the reason being that they are presentations, not representations. Linguistic 
expressions do have to be deciphered if their contents are to be uploaded, the 
reason being that they are representations, not presentations. [continues for ~250 words]
```

**Characteristics:**
- Length: ~250 words
- Single dense paragraph
- Regress argument structure
- Technical philosophical terminology
- No empirical references
- Compressed logical steps

### CORRECT OUTPUT (Intelligence-Maximized Version)

**Characteristics:**
- Length: ~4,500 words
- Detailed section structure
- Extensive empirical grounding:
  - V1 neuron firing patterns
  - Reaction time studies (specific latencies: 150-200ms)
  - Infant habituation studies (3-month-olds)
  - VWFA neuroimaging
  - Masked priming experiments
  - Acquired dyslexia patient studies
  - Cross-linguistic neuroimaging
  - Embodied cognition research
  - Semantic dementia patterns
  - Animal cognition (corvids, primates, cetaceans, grey parrots)
  - Binocular rivalry experiments
  - Inferotemporal cortex recordings
  - VR studies of belief formation
  - Category-specific semantic deficits

**Key Features of Correct Approach:**
1. Presentation vs. Representation distinction elaborated over multiple paragraphs
2. Regress argument broken into explicit numbered premises (Premise 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, Conclusion)
3. Each response to the argument (4 different responses) fully developed and refuted
4. Empirical evidence integrated at every step
5. Technical terms defined and illustrated
6. Multiple independent arguments against functional role semantics
7. Cross-disciplinary evidence synthesis (neuroscience, developmental psych, animal cognition, patient studies)

### FAILED OUTPUT (Replit's Version)

```
Sense-perceptions are direct experiences that do not require interpretation to be 
understood; they are presentations, not representations. In contrast, linguistic 
expressions must be interpreted because they are representations, not direct 
presentations. It is a fundamental error to assume that all information-bearing 
mental entities are inherently representations rather than presentations. 
Consequently, it is incoherent to claim that thought is always mediated by 
linguistic expressions or symbols. Efforts to counter this critique often stretch 
the definition of linguistic symbols too far, ultimately undermining the very 
argument they aim to support. Furthermore, these efforts typically rely on the 
flawed assumption that a mental entity's information content is determined solely 
by its causal role. This assumption is demonstrably incorrect, leading to the 
inevitable failure of attempts to argue that thought is universally mediated by 
linguistic symbols.
```

**Characteristics of FAILURE:**
- Length: ~140 words (REDUCED from 250-word input!)
- Single paragraph (no structure added)
- ZERO empirical references
- ZERO citations
- Simplified vocabulary ("direct experiences" replacing technical "presentations")
- Compressed arguments (entire regress argument reduced to "it is a fundamental error")
- Vague generalizations ("often stretch the definition" vs. specific enumeration of attempts)
- Loss of technical precision
- Removed complexity rather than adding it

**What Went Wrong:**
1. **Reversed the core instruction** - Simplified instead of elaborating
2. **Ignored "empirical grounding" requirement** - No studies cited
3. **Failed to make implicit explicit** - Compressed logical steps further
4. **Reduced technical precision** - Substituted casual language
5. **Decreased length** - Made shorter, not longer
6. **Lost argumentative structure** - No premises, no systematic development
7. **Genericized claims** - "Demonstrably incorrect" with no demonstration

## Detailed Specification: What Intelligence Maximization Requires

### Principle 1: EXPANSION RATIO
- **Minimum target:** 4-6x word count increase
- **Typical range:** 250 words → 1,500-3,000 words
- **Method:** Every sentence becomes a paragraph or multiple paragraphs

**Example Application:**

INPUT SENTENCE:
```
"It is viciously regressive to suppose that information-bearing mental entities 
are categorically in the nature of representations"
```

FAILED APPROACH (Replit):
```
"It is a fundamental error to assume that all information-bearing mental entities 
are inherently representations"
```
[No expansion, just paraphrase]

CORRECT APPROACH:
```
"It is viciously regressive to suppose that information-bearing mental entities 
are categorically in the nature of representations, as opposed to presentations. 
Let us make the regress argument completely explicit through a step-by-step derivation:

Premise 1: If mental state M is a representation, then accessing M's content 
requires an interpretive process D that decodes M.

[Continue with Premises 2-5 and Conclusion, each fully elaborated]

Empirical evidence supports this conclusion. Research on semantic memory 
demonstrates that conceptual knowledge is ultimately grounded in sensory-motor 
experiences that have presentational character..."

[Continue with multiple empirical examples]
```

### Principle 2: EMPIRICAL GROUNDING

Every significant claim must be connected to empirical evidence where possible.

**Required elements:**
- Specific study types (e.g., "neuroimaging studies," "reaction time studies")
- Concrete findings (e.g., "75% of participants," "150-200ms latencies")
- Research paradigms (e.g., "habituation paradigms," "masked priming")
- Patient populations (e.g., "acquired dyslexia," "semantic dementia")
- Cross-species evidence where relevant
- Specific brain regions (e.g., "VWFA in left fusiform gyrus")

**Example Application:**

INPUT CLAIM:
```
"Linguistic expressions do have to be deciphered if their contents are to be uploaded"
```

FAILED APPROACH (Replit):
```
"linguistic expressions must be interpreted because they are representations"
```
[No empirical evidence added]

CORRECT APPROACH:
```
"Linguistic expressions do have to be deciphered if their contents are to be uploaded, 
the reason being that they are representations, not presentations. Consider written 
language as the clearest case. The string of marks "CAT" does not make feline 
information immediately available to a cognitive system. Rather, these marks must 
be processed through multiple stages: visual recognition of letter forms, 
phonological decoding, lexical access, and semantic retrieval. 

Neuroimaging studies of reading demonstrate precisely this multi-stage architecture. 
The visual word form area (VWFA) in left fusiform gyrus responds to orthographic 
patterns; activation then spreads to phonological areas in left superior temporal 
cortex and semantic areas in left anterior temporal lobe. Crucially, this processing 
cascade takes time—studies using masked priming and event-related potentials show 
distinct processing stages separated by tens of milliseconds.

Patients with acquired dyslexia demonstrate this point dramatically. These individuals 
can see the written words (visual perception is intact) but cannot access their 
meanings (the decoding mechanism is damaged)..."
```

### Principle 3: MAXIMAL EXPLICITNESS

Make every logical step, inference, and connection explicit.

**Required techniques:**
- Use phrases like "Let us make this completely explicit..."
- Number premises in arguments
- State inferential connections explicitly ("This follows from..." "Therefore...")
- Elaborate implicit assumptions
- Define technical terms
- Provide multiple examples for abstract concepts
- Anticipate and address potential objections

**Example Application:**

INPUT STRUCTURE:
```
"Also, it is inherent in the nature of such attempts that they assume the truth 
of the view that for a given mental entity to bear this as opposed to that 
information is for that entity to have this as opposed to that causal role. 
This view is demonstrably false"
```

FAILED APPROACH (Replit):
```
"Furthermore, these efforts typically rely on the flawed assumption that a mental 
entity's information content is determined solely by its causal role. This 
assumption is demonstrably incorrect"
```
[No elaboration of why, no explicit argument structure]

CORRECT APPROACH:
```
"Also, it is inherent in the nature of such attempts that they assume the truth 
of the view that for a given mental entity to bear this as opposed to that 
information is for that entity to have this as opposed to that causal role. 
Let us make this assumption completely explicit and explain why it is required 
by the functional role response.

The functional role theory holds that mental state M has content C if and only if 
M has functional role F, where F consists in M's causal relations to sensory inputs, 
behavioral outputs, and other mental states. [Detailed explanation]

This theory would, if true, block the regress argument. [Explicit explanation of why]

However, this view is demonstrably false. Let us present multiple empirical 
arguments against functional role semantics:

**Argument from Content Determinacy:** [Full development]

**Argument from Swap Cases:** [Full development]

**Argument from Narrow Content:** [Full development]

**Argument from Functional Role Indeterminacy:** [Full development]

**Argument from Neurological Dissociations:** [Full development]
```

### Principle 4: STRUCTURED ELABORATION

Organize expanded material with clear structure.

**Required elements:**
- Section headers where appropriate
- Clear paragraph breaks
- Explicit signposting ("First..., Second..., Third...")
- Numbered lists for premises/arguments
- Bold or italic emphasis for key terms (first use)
- Transitional phrases between sections

### Principle 5: PRESERVATION OF ORIGINAL

Never delete, simplify, or lose any content from the original.

**Rules:**
- Every sentence from input appears in output (possibly elaborated)
- Original technical terminology preserved
- Original argument structure maintained (then expanded)
- Original examples kept (then supplemented with additional examples)
- Original phrasing quoted or closely paraphrased before elaboration

## Implementation Requirements for AI System

### PRE-PROCESSING CHECK

Before beginning expansion, the system must:

1. **Identify original argument structure**
   - Main thesis
   - Supporting claims
   - Examples
   - Implicit premises

2. **Flag claims requiring empirical support**
   - Factual claims about psychology/cognition
   - Claims about behavior
   - Claims about biological/neural mechanisms
   - Claims requiring evidence rather than pure logic

3. **Identify implicit logical steps**
   - Unstated premises
   - Compressed inferences
   - Assumed background knowledge

### EXPANSION PROCESS

For each paragraph in input:

1. **Preserve original sentence** (quoted or closely paraphrased)

2. **Add explicit framing**
   - "Let us make this completely explicit..."
   - "This requires unpacking in detail..."
   - "The full argument runs as follows..."

3. **Insert empirical grounding**
   - Specific studies
   - Data points
   - Experimental paradigms
   - Patient populations
   - Cross-species evidence

4. **Elaborate logical structure**
   - Number premises if argument present
   - State inferential connections
   - Make conditionals explicit

5. **Add examples**
   - Concrete instances
   - Contrasting cases
   - Thought experiments backed by empirical considerations

6. **Address potential objections**
   - Anticipate counter-arguments
   - Refute with evidence

### QUALITY CHECKS

Output must satisfy:

- [ ] Length increased by minimum 400%
- [ ] Every major claim has empirical grounding where applicable
- [ ] All implicit logical steps made explicit
- [ ] Technical terms defined on first use
- [ ] Arguments structured with numbered premises where appropriate
- [ ] Multiple examples provided for abstract concepts
- [ ] At least 3-5 empirical studies cited per major section
- [ ] Cross-disciplinary evidence integrated (neuroscience, psychology, biology, etc.)
- [ ] No original content deleted or oversimplified
- [ ] Original technical vocabulary preserved

---

## Red Flags Indicating Failure

If the system produces output with these characteristics, it has FAILED:

1. **Length decreased or remained similar** - Automatic failure
2. **No empirical citations** - Automatic failure  
3. **Simplified vocabulary** ("direct experiences" for "presentations") - Failure
4. **Vague generalizations** ("often," "typically") without specific examples - Failure
5. **Compressed arguments** - Failure
6. **Single paragraph when input was single paragraph** - Should expand to multiple sections
7. **Phrases like "in simpler terms" or "to put it simply"** - Wrong direction entirely

---

## Correct Mental Model for the Task

The system must understand this is:

**NOT:** Simplification, summarization, paraphrasing, making accessible, reducing complexity

**IS:** Academic elaboration, scholastic expansion, empirical fortification, logical explication, argumentative amplification

**Metaphor:** Taking a compressed philosophical diamond and expanding it into a fully-articulated multi-faceted crystal structure with empirical scaffolding.

**Target audience:** Advanced graduate students and professional philosophers who want maximum rigor, not general readers who want accessibility.

**Goal:** Transform a tight argument into a comprehensive scholarly treatment that could appear in a peer-reviewed philosophy of mind journal.

---

## Conclusion

The Replit system failed catastrophically because it applied a **simplification heuristic** when an **elaboration requirement** was specified. This represents the worst possible misunderstanding of the task—doing precisely the opposite of what was requested.

The correct approach requires:
1. Massive expansion (4-10x length)
2. Dense empirical integration (studies, data, experiments)
3. Complete logical explication (numbered premises, explicit inferences)
4. Technical precision maintenance (preserve original terminology)
5. Structured development (sections, examples, objections)

Any AI system implementing "intelligence maximization" must understand that it means **ADDING INTELLIGENCE** to the text—more evidence, more explicit reasoning, more structure, more detail—never subtracting, simplifying, or condensing.
