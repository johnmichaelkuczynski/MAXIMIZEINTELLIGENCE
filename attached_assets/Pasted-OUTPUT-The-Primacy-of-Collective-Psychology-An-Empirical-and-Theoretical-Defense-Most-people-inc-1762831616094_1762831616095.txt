OUTPUT: The Primacy of Collective Psychology: An Empirical and Theoretical Defense
Most people, including most psychologists, operate on the assumption that group psychology is to be understood in terms of individual psychology. This methodological individualism posits that individuals possess various self-directed drives and that, in group contexts, these drives are somehow diverted away from their normal paths and pressed into aims that, not being self-directed, are alien to their fundamental nature. The implicit model here is one of reduction: collective behavior is treated as an epiphenomenon—a mere aggregate or distortion of underlying individual psychological processes.
This position is understandable, and is at least descriptively correct, where very basic drives are concerned—drives relating to immediate threats to one's survival and to the prospect of immediate carnal gratification. Empirical research on fight-or-flight responses demonstrates that individual survival mechanisms operate relatively independently of social context when immediate physical threats are present. Similarly, studies of sexual motivation show that basic appetitive drives can override social considerations under conditions of high arousal and opportunity. In these limited domains, the methodological individualist framework appears adequate because the relevant psychological mechanisms are phylogenetically ancient, relatively stereotyped, and demonstrably present across mammalian species operating both socially and solitarily.
However, this methodological stance cannot be reconciled with the incredibly high degree of conformism exhibited by people—even after intellectual shortcomings on their part are taken into account—to other people's opinions. Solomon Asch's classic conformity experiments revealed that approximately 75% of participants conformed to obviously incorrect group judgments at least once, with about 32% of all responses conforming to the erroneous majority. Crucially, these effects persisted even when the perceptual task was unambiguous and participants were demonstrably capable of accurate independent judgment. Follow-up studies using neuroimaging have shown that social conformity actually alters perceptual processing in early visual cortex, suggesting that social influence operates at a level more fundamental than mere strategic misreporting. This is not merely strategic deference born of rational self-interest; the conformist tendency appears to reshape cognitive processing itself.
Nor can methodological individualism be reconciled—even after people's fear of others is taken into account—with the deference given by people, at the expense of their own gratification, to convention and to pre-existing custom, as well as to fleeting but powerful fads. Research on costly punishment in economic games demonstrates that individuals will sacrifice personal resources to enforce group norms even in anonymous, one-shot interactions where no reputational benefit is possible. If individuals were fundamentally self-directed agents whose behavior in groups represented merely a strategic accommodation to threats, we would not observe such willingness to bear costs for norm enforcement in contexts where defection carries no penalty. Similarly, anthropological studies of food taboos show that adherence to culturally-specific dietary restrictions persists even when individuals relocate to contexts where violation would be undetectable and where the prohibited foods would provide significant nutritional or hedonic value. The power of convention exceeds what can be explained by fear of social sanction.
The puzzle deepens when we consider fashion cycles and fads. Studies of adoption curves for consumer products, linguistic innovations, and cultural practices reveal dynamics that cannot be predicted from individual preferences but emerge from network-level processes. Mathematical models show that critical mass phenomena and cascading adoption require treating social influence as a fundamental force rather than as a secondary perturbation of individual choice. People adopt fads not because these serve pre-existing individual goals, but because the collective dynamics themselves generate new goals and values.
Also, given how unintelligent, ignorant, and lacking in moral fiber most individuals are—and yet how much intelligence, knowledge, and moral rigor is embodied in the behavior of collectives, such as corporations and academic disciplines—it is hard to believe that such collectives are the result of various bona fide individuals pursuing their respective paths. Research on the "wisdom of crowds" phenomenon demonstrates that aggregated judgments of groups systematically outperform the average individual judgment and often exceed even expert performance, but only when aggregation mechanisms are properly structured. The explanation cannot simply be statistical averaging, because averaging preserves only the central tendency of individual capacities—it cannot generate emergent capabilities that exceed those of all constituent members.
Consider academic disciplines as a concrete example. Historical analysis of scientific progress shows that major theoretical advances typically emerge from collective processes spanning multiple researchers and institutions over extended periods, rather than from isolated individual insights. Individual scientists make errors, exhibit biases, and pursue dead ends. Yet the institution of science—with its peer review, replication norms, and competitive hypothesis testing—generates cumulative knowledge that far exceeds what any individual could produce. Studies of collaboration networks reveal that scientific impact correlates more strongly with network position and collaborative structure than with individual metrics like IQ or prior productivity. The intelligence is in the system, not merely in the agents.
Similarly, consider corporate behavior. Individual employees may be self-interested, short-sighted, and cognitively limited. Yet organizational theory demonstrates that well-designed corporate structures can systematically produce decisions that exhibit rationality, foresight, and coordination that no individual member possesses. Research on organizational routines shows that much corporate knowledge is embodied in procedures, role structures, and cultural practices rather than in the explicit beliefs of any individual. When key individuals leave, the organization retains capabilities that those individuals helped instantiate but did not individually possess.
It seems rather as though the collective is the primary thing, biologically speaking, and there is an illusion of individual choice and, indeed, of individualism per se. The phenomenology of autonomous decision-making may itself be a functional adaptation that serves collective-level goals rather than representing the ontological bedrock of human psychology.
The Cell Analogy: Making the Argument from Biology Explicit
A cell is an individual organism. But how well can you understand a cell if you try to understand it on its own terms? Pretty well but not maximally well. If you tried to understand its behavior in terms of a drive on its part to live or flourish or reproduce, you would get far. Cellular biology successfully explains many phenomena—metabolism, homeostasis, mitosis—by treating cells as autonomous units with their own survival machinery. But there would still be some unanswered, and unanswerable, questions.
Consider apoptosis—programmed cell death. From an individual-cell perspective, apoptosis appears maladaptive: the cell actively dismantles itself through a genetically-encoded suicide program. Why would an organism whose fundamental drive is survival and reproduction possess elaborate mechanisms for self-destruction? The individualist framework struggles here. But from a multicellular perspective, apoptosis is clearly adaptive: it eliminates damaged cells, sculpts developing tissues, and prevents cancer by removing cells with replication errors. The cell's "decision" to undergo apoptosis only makes sense when we recognize that the cell exists primarily as a component of a larger organism.
Similarly, consider cellular differentiation. Stem cells that differentiate into specialized cell types permanently surrender their pluripotency and reproductive potential. A neuron will never reproduce; its developmental pathway has closed off this possibility. From an individual-cell perspective focused on reproduction, differentiation represents reproductive suicide. But from a multicellular perspective, differentiation is essential: organisms require specialized cell types with division of labor. The neuron's inability to reproduce serves the reproductive interests of the organism as a whole, which depends on neural function for survival and mate acquisition.
But suppose you tried to understand individual cells in the following way: They individually try to survive, flourish and reproduce to the extent—but only to the extent—that their trying to do so is necessary for the collectives formed thereby to survive and flourish and reproduce. In that case, I would suggest, you will get at least as far as you did with your other hypothesis, and probably further.
This reframing resolves the puzzles. Apoptosis exists because multicellular organisms require mechanisms for eliminating defective components; cells possess apoptotic machinery because lineages lacking such mechanisms were outcompeted by lineages whose cellular components could sacrifice themselves for organismal integrity. Differentiation exists because multicellular organisms with specialized tissues outcompete those without; individual cells possess differentiation pathways because being part of an organism with division of labor provides better reproductive prospects than solitary existence.
Cell-individualism can be explained in terms of cell collectivism, but not so much vice versa. The characteristics that cells possess as individuals—their survival drives, their reproductive machinery, their homeostatic mechanisms—can be understood as those characteristics necessary for cells to function as components of multicellular organisms. The evolutionary trajectory that produced eukaryotic cells was fundamentally shaped by selective pressures operating at the level of multicellular collectives. The endosymbiotic theory of eukaryotic origins demonstrates that even the internal structure of individual cells reflects a history of collective formation, with mitochondria and chloroplasts representing formerly independent organisms now permanently integrated into cellular architecture.
Conversely, trying to explain multicellular organisms purely in terms of individual cellular properties faces insurmountable difficulties. The transition to multicellularity required the evolution of mechanisms for cellular communication, adhesion, and coordinated gene expression that have no function for solitary cells. These are not properties that cells possessed independently and then happened to combine; they are properties that exist only in and for collective contexts.
Extending the Argument to Human Psychology
Similarly, person-individualism can be explained in terms of person-collectivism, but not so much vice versa. The parallel between cellular and human organization is not merely metaphorical; it reflects a general principle about how evolution structures biological systems at multiple scales.
Bona fide individuals—people who think for themselves: geniuses, in other words—can be seen as limiting cases of collectives. Let us make this argument maximally explicit by considering three possible interpretations, each increasingly radical:
First interpretation: Geniuses as collectives of one. Even the most innovative thinker operates with cognitive tools, conceptual frameworks, and problems inherited from their intellectual tradition. Studies of scientific creativity show that breakthrough insights typically recombine existing ideas in novel ways rather than generating entirely de novo concepts. Newton's famous remark about "standing on the shoulders of giants" reflects the empirical reality that even revolutionary thinkers work within paradigms established by predecessors. The genius internalizes a collective discourse and conducts an internal dialogue that resembles the external dialogues of collaborative groups. Their apparent individuality may represent a compressed or internalized form of collective process.
Second interpretation: Geniuses as rogue actors. Alternatively, genuinely original thinkers might represent defectors or mutants within collective structures—individuals whose psychological makeup deviates from the norm in ways that occasionally generate novelty. Research on creativity and psychopathology reveals elevated rates of mood disorders, schizotypy, and ADHD among highly creative individuals, suggesting that creativity may involve atypical cognitive processing. But even here, the collective framework remains primary: rogue actors are defined by their deviation from collective norms, and their innovations succeed only when adopted by the collective. Studies of innovation diffusion show that even brilliant ideas fail to gain traction without social networks positioned to recognize and propagate them.
Third interpretation: Geniuses as specialized collective members. Most likely, apparent individuals occupy unusual offices within their collectives and are therefore seen, wrongly, as not being a part of those collectives. Consider the role of "intellectual" or "innovator" within human societies. Anthropological research on shamans, prophets, and wise men across cultures reveals that societies systematically create and maintain specialized roles for individuals who challenge conventional wisdom. These individuals are not outside the collective but perform a specific function within it: generating variation upon which collective-level selection can operate.
Think of the parallels to biological systems. In the immune system, somatic hypermutation introduces random variation into antibody genes, generating diversity that allows the immune system to respond to novel pathogens. The mutations occur in individual cells, but the process serves immune-system-level adaptation. Similarly, geniuses may represent "cognitive mutations"—individuals whose thought processes deviate from the norm in ways that generate variation for collective-level selection. Their apparent autonomy is functional: they must believe themselves to be thinking independently in order to generate genuinely novel variations. But the ultimate explanation for why such individuals exist lies at the collective level.
And the intense drives that individuals have to survive and experience gratification can be seen as being necessary for the existence of, and therefore explainable in terms of, the collectives to which they belong. Let us unpack this crucial claim with maximum explicitness.
Evolutionary game theory demonstrates that stable cooperation in social groups requires mechanisms for aligning individual incentives with collective outcomes. One solution is to structure individual psychology such that individuals derive satisfaction from behaviors that serve collective function. Research on prosocial behavior shows that humans experience intrinsic reward from cooperation, fairness, and norm compliance—neural imaging reveals activation of reward circuitry in ventral striatum when engaging in cooperative behavior or punishing defectors.
Consider sexual desire as a concrete example. From a naively individualist perspective, sexual desire serves individual reproduction. But this cannot be the complete story. Human sexuality is dramatically oversexed relative to reproductive needs—people engage in sexual activity far more frequently than required for reproduction, and much sexual behavior is non-reproductive. This makes sense from a pair-bonding perspective: frequent sexual activity maintains pair bonds that enable biparental care, which dramatically increases offspring survival in humans. The individual drive serves collective (familial) function. Moreover, human sexuality exhibits features like concealed ovulation that appear maladaptive for individual female mate choice but facilitate stable pair bonding by maintaining male investment.
Similarly, consider the drive for status and recognition. Status seeking appears to be a fundamental human motivation, but the specific behaviors that confer status are almost entirely culturally determined. In some societies, generosity confers status; in others, martial prowess; in still others, aesthetic sophistication or ascetic self-denial. The drive itself is universal and powerful, but it is a drive to conform to culturally-specific status hierarchies. This is precisely what we would expect if individual drives exist to maintain collective structures: the motivational system is designed to be filled in by collective norms.
Thus, the facts relating to individual psychology can be reconciled with the view that group psychology is primary. Individual survival drives exist because collectives require individual components to maintain themselves. Individual desires for gratification exist because collectives require motivational systems to direct individual behavior toward collective-serving ends. Individual capacities for autonomous decision-making exist because collectives benefit from distributed information processing and from variation-generating mechanisms. None of this denies the reality of individual experience or the importance of individual-level analysis. But it reverses the explanatory priority: individual psychology is structured the way it is because of collective-level selective pressures.
The Failures of Methodological Individualism
But the opposite seems not to be true. It is very hard to explain group behavior—be the group in question a mere mob or an organized anti-mob, such as an advanced culture—on the assumption that these collectives represent averages of the behaviors of so many armies of one—of so many self-contained existentialist autonomous deciders.
Let us make this negative argument fully explicit by examining specific empirical domains where methodological individualism fails:
Domain 1: Collective action and public goods. Rational choice theory, grounded in methodological individualism, predicts systematic failure of public goods provision due to free-rider problems. Yet empirical research consistently finds higher levels of cooperation in public goods games than predicted by models assuming self-interested individuals. Meta-analyses of public goods experiments show average contribution rates around 40-60% of endowments, far exceeding the zero contribution predicted by individual rationality. Methodological individualism must then add epicycles—reputation effects, repeated game considerations, confused preferences—to explain behavior that follows naturally from collective-first psychology.
Domain 2: Moral judgment and punishment. If individuals were fundamentally self-directed, we would expect moral judgments to track personal consequences—actions that harm the judge should be condemned, actions that benefit the judge should be praised. Instead, research on moral psychology reveals that judgments are primarily organized around group norms and social categories rather than personal impact. People condemn norm violations even when they personally benefit from them and excuse norm-conforming behavior even when personally harmed, provided the actor shares their group identity. This pattern reflects collective-level moral psychology, not individual-level consequentialism.
Domain 3: Cultural transmission and persistence. Research on cultural evolution shows that behaviors persist across generations with extremely high fidelity, far exceeding what could be maintained by individual learning or rational calculation. Studies of isolated cultural groups reveal the maintenance of highly specific practices—ritual sequences, grammatical rules, craft techniques—with minimal variation over centuries. If individuals were primarily self-directed agents who happened to interact, cultural practices would exhibit continuous drift as individuals introduced variations based on personal experience and reasoning. Instead, we observe near-perfect copying combined with resistance to innovation—the signature of collective-level stabilization mechanisms.
Outside of contexts where there are well-defined and immediate threats to physical well-being or where there are equally well-defined prospects of crude forms of gratification—outside of such contexts, people are predisposed to give far too much weight, and in far too well-defined ways, to existing beliefs and mores than can be accounted for in terms of the hypothesis that collectives are indeed collectives of bona fide individuals.
The specificity of this claim warrants emphasis. We are not claiming that individual psychology is irrelevant or epiphenomenal across all domains. Rather, the claim is precisely circumscribed: in domains involving social beliefs, norms, and culturally-mediated behaviors, individual psychology exhibits features that cannot be explained on the assumption of fundamental individual autonomy.
Research on belief formation demonstrates that on factual questions with verifiable answers (e.g., mathematical problems, empirical predictions), individuals often revise beliefs based on evidence and reasoning; but on questions involving social norms, group identity, or culturally-contested values, the same individuals exhibit extreme resistance to counter-evidence and strong conformity to group consensus. This domain-specificity suggests that human psychology contains specialized systems for collective coordination that operate independently of—and often override—individual reasoning capacities.
Developmental psychology reveals that children acquire cultural norms through high-fidelity copying that exceeds rational imitation; children replicate even causally irrelevant actions when learning cultural practices, a phenomenon called "overimitation". This contrasts with pragmatic problem-solving domains where children readily ignore demonstrated actions in favor of more efficient alternatives. The psychology of cultural transmission appears designed for collective-level stability rather than individual-level optimization.
The weight given to existing beliefs and mores is also "far too well-defined" to be explained by individual psychology. If conformism merely reflected individual uncertainty or desire for social acceptance, we would expect it to vary continuously with factors like personal confidence, situational stakes, and social consequences. Instead, research reveals highly structured conformity patterns: strong conformity to in-group norms combined with rejection of out-group norms, conformity specifically to prestigious individuals, and conformity that increases rather than decreases when individuals possess greater expertise. These patterns reflect evolved collective-maintenance mechanisms rather than individual strategic calculations.
The explanatory asymmetry is complete: collective psychology can accommodate individual variation as a special case (individuals as specialized collective components or as variation-generating mechanisms), but individual psychology cannot accommodate collective regularities without abandoning its core commitments. Methodological individualism survives only by adding so many collective-level corrections and epicycles that the individual is no longer doing any fundamental explanatory work. The more parsimonious hypothesis is that collective psychology is biologically primary, and individual psychology represents a sophisticated but derivative adaptation designed to serve collective-level functions.
