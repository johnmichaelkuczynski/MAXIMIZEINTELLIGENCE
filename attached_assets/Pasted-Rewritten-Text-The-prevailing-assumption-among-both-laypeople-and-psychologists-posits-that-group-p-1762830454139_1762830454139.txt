The prevailing assumption among both laypeople and psychologists posits that group psychology is merely an extension of individual psychology, wherein individuals possess self-directed drives that, within group contexts, are redirected towards collective aims that diverge from personal intentions. This perspective holds descriptive validity when considering primal drives related to immediate survival threats or carnal gratification. However, this framework fails to account for the profound conformism individuals exhibit towards collective opinions, even when intellectual deficits and social fears are considered. It also inadequately explains the deference individuals show to societal conventions and transient fads, often at the expense of personal gratification.

Moreover, the apparent intelligence, knowledge, and moral rigor manifested by collectives such as corporations and academic disciplines starkly contrast with the perceived deficiencies in these qualities among individuals. This discrepancy suggests that collectives may be the primary biological entities, with individual autonomy being an illusion. Analogously, while a cell can be understood as an individual organism, a comprehensive understanding emerges only when considering its role within the collective organism. A cell's survival and reproduction efforts are meaningful insofar as they contribute to the collective's flourishing. Thus, cell behavior is better explained through the lens of collectivism rather than individualism.

Similarly, person-individualism is more coherently explained through person-collectivism. Individuals who exhibit independent thought, often labeled as geniuses, can be perceived as unique manifestations within collectives, either as collectives of one or as atypical members with distinct roles. The intense drives for survival and gratification in individuals are necessary for the sustenance of the collectives they inhabit, thereby aligning individual psychology with the primacy of group psychology.

Conversely, explaining group behavior through the aggregation of autonomous individual actions proves inadequate. Outside contexts of immediate physical threats or basic gratification opportunities, individuals disproportionately adhere to established beliefs and norms, a phenomenon not easily reconciled with the notion of collectives as mere aggregates of autonomous decision-makers. Thus, the hypothesis that collectives are fundamentally composed of bona fide individuals is insufficient to account for the complexities of group dynamics.
